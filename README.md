# WYSIWYG Markdown Editor
This project is a basic WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) markdown editor with support for headings, bold, italic, and bold italic text formatting.
## Demo
Check out the live demo [here](https://el-ahmed.github.io/WYSIWYG-Markdown-Editor/).
## Features
- **Headings:** Use # for heading 1, ## for heading 2, and so on up to heading 6. The hashes will not appear if your cursor is on a different line.
- **Bold Italic:** Wrap your text in *** to make it bold and italic.
- **Bold:** Wrap your text in ** to make it bold.
- **Italic:** Wrap your text in * to make it italic.
- **Links:** Create links using \[title](link).
- **Formatting Symbols:** Asterisks and hashes hide when you are not on the same line.
- **File Download:** Download your markdown file as a string.
- **File Upload:** Upload a markdown text file.
## Usage
1. Creating Headings:
   - Type # followed by your heading text for an H1 heading.
   - Use additional hashes for smaller headings (e.g., ## for H2, ### for H3, etc.).
2. Bold, Italic, and Bold Italic:
   - Wrap your text in * for italic: *italic*
   - Wrap your text in ** for bold: **bold**
   - Wrap your text in *** for bold italic: ***bold italic***
3. Links:
   - Create a link by wrapping the link text in square brackets [ ] and the URL in parentheses ( )
4. Hiding Formatting Symbols:
   - The formatting symbols (hashes and asterisks) will only appear when your cursor is on the same line as the text. They will hide when you move to a different line.
5. File Operations:
   - Download: Click the download button to save your markdown file as a string.
